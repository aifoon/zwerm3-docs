# Introduction

![A screenshot of the kweenb application](/img/hero-image.png)

**kweenb** is the audio management software where you can:

- Manage the swarm by adding new bees, activating or deactivating them.
- Connect the active swarm to start streaming audio with Jacktrip, supporting both peer-to-peer and hub mode.
- Connect the active swarm to start triggering actions via OSC.
- Disconnect the swarm and cleanup all the open connections
- Adjust the Jack and Jacktrip settings used during connection.
- Upload and manage audio files on each bee
- Use positioning that interacts with the MQTT server of Pozyx and translates that data into audio parameters (e.g. volume)
- Configure the bee by calling endpoints from zwerm3-api
- Use various tools to validate each step in the connection process.

## Architecture

### Desktop Application

**kweenb** is built with Electron, which enables the creation of cross-platform desktop applications using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Node.js is used on the backend to interact with the native desktop operating system. The project follows a typical Electron application structure, which consists of three main parts: `main`, `preload`, and `renderer`.

#### Main Process

The [**main process**](main/introduction) functions as a Node.js backend server. It handles communication between the backend and the frontend, allowing data to be exchanged between the main process and the renderer.

</LinkButtonGroup>

#### Preload Process

The **preload process** acts as a security layer between the Electron main process and the renderer. Direct access to the main process is restricted, and only a carefully chosen set of methods, actions, and events can be exposed to the renderer.

#### Renderer Process

The **renderer** is the frontend of the application. We use React as the frontend framework, building the UI with reusable components. These components are shared with the web interface used for triggering actions.

</LinkButtonGroup>

#### Interface (triggering)

The triggering interface is a web application that is served once **kweenb** is fully started. When accessed, it connects to a Socket.io server hosted by **kweenb**, enabling real-time communication with the swarm. This allows the interface to fetch the current swarm, send OSC messages, retrieve audio scenes, and more.

</LinkButtonGroup>

#### React Components

We reuse React components between the kweenb `renderer` and the web `interface` (for triggering). This shared component architecture allows for faster development and easier updates across both the desktop and web interfaces.

</LinkButtonGroup>

#### Types

Everything is typed via Typescript and shared with `main`, `preload`, `renderer` and `interface`. The shared Types can be found in the shared folder.
