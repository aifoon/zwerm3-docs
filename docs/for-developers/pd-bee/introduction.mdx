# Introduction

![A screenshot of pd-bee patch](/img/for-developers/pd-bee/pd-bee.png)

## Startup

Initial values of the patch are:

- **masterBass**: 1 (value from 0 - 2)
- **masterMid**: 1 (value from 0 - 2)
- **masterLow**: 1 (value from 0 - 2)
- **useEq**: 1 (value 0 or 1)
- **volume**: 1 (value 0 - 100)
- **fileLoop**: 1 (value 0 or 1)

## Dependencies

- **foonLib**: a library written by aifoon to start playing files
- **ggee**: ggee is a library by Guenter Geiger with five sections: control, experimental, filters, gui, and signal.
- **readanysf~**: a patch to read a wav file
- **osc**: a collection of Pd objectclasses for OSC-messages. These objects only convert between Pd-messages and OSC-messages (binary format), so you will need a separate set of objects that implement the transport (OSI-Layer 4), for instance [udpsend]/[udpreceive] for sending OSC over UDP. Written by Martin Peach.
- **iemnet**: this is a fork of martin peach's "net" library, that allows low-level interaction with networks on OSI-layer 5 (transport layer).

## OSC Actions

You can send an OSC message over UDP to the bee, to port 9001. This is the protocol

- **/masterBass [0-2]**: sets the lower frequencies
- **/masterHigh [0-2]**: sets the higher frequencies
- **/masterMid [0-2]**: sets the mid frequencies
- **/volume [0-100]**: sets the volume
- **/fileLoop [0 or 1]**: sets the file loop
- **/useEq [0 or 1]**: sets equalizing
- **/start [name of the file].wav**: start a file with the given path (files ore stored on in `/home/pi/pd-bee/files/[filename].wav`)
- **/stop**: stop the file playing

## Stream and trigger

- Any incoming stream is send to the left and the right channel of the speaker.
- For triggering, the left and right channel are splitted to the left and right channel of the file itself
